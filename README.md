# Kanban Board

## For YH Bor√•s, Class F25D

## Instructions
The instructions for this assignment was to create a Kanban-Board type App where the user could plan their projects or tasks. There are 3 columns with different categories: To do, Doing & Done. In these columns tasks will be placed as cards. Tasks can be added, removed, edited and have their status changed (ex. from "To Do" to "Done"). Each new task has a title, optional description, and an auto-generated date. Lastly, each column can be clicked to navigate only to that column which has its own URL so that it can be bookmarked. 

## Thanks for looking at my project!
